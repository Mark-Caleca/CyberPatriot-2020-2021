# CyberPatriot-2020-2021
This repository is a clone of several system hardening scripts my team and I wrote for the 2020-2021 CyberPatriot season, since the original repository is private. The main file is "cpxiii-auto.bat". WARNING! DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN THESE ON YOUR PERSONAL COMPUTER! Many of the settings configured by these scripts are beyond what the standard user would need to (or should) configure.
